Hey there üëã My name is **jay4q** .

I was graduated from [Soochow University](https://www.suda.edu.cn/) . I always nurse passions for creating various stuff, For there are plenty of wired ideas messing around my head. That's why i chose Software Engineering as major.

I am working at [3lengjing](https://www.3lengjing.com/home) , A company provides digital service for museums in china, And currently in transition to online education. I am a fan of `React` & `Typescript` & `Nodejs` . With help of these techs, I had shipped several stable projects for the company.

Currently, I'm working on `Headless CMS` and `JAMStack` for business.

In my spare time, I love cooking„ÄÅthinking and gaming, And this [blog](https://github.com/jay4q/blog) mainly records my hobbies.
