Hey there ~

My name is **jay4q** (inspired by D4C in JOJO) .

I was graduated from [Soochow University](https://www.suda.edu.cn/) . I always nurse passions for creating various stuff, for there are plenty of wired ideas messing around my head. That's why i chose Software Engineering as major.

I am working at [3lengjing](https://www.3lengjing.com/home), a company provides digital service for museums in china, and currently in transition to education. I am a fan of `React` & `Typescript` & `Nodejs` . With help of these techs, i had shipped several stable projects for the company.

Currently, I'm working on CMS and JAMStack for business.

In my spare time, i love cooking/eating„ÄÅthinking and gaming, and this blog mainly records my hobbies.
